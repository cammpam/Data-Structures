This lab took 2hrs to finish
The biggest challenge I had for this lab is understanding the concept of the pivot.
I learned that quick sort will sort by comparing each index with the pivot, and the pivot can determine the output of the sort. 
I used my partner mostly as a resource for this lab since he had a good understanding of quick sort already.
