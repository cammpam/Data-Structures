This lab took me about 4 hours to complete
The biggest challenge was trying to understand how the array was merging back together after its be sorted. 
I learned that the merg sort algorithm is way harder then it sounds.
I used  https://gist.github.com/pmgeorg/9122984 and c#-corner as my resources.
